<p>The name Lahti, Pyry-Samuli Lahti, and the Legend begins on January 18th of year 1983. The day I was born.</p>

<p>
  I lived the first six year of my life in the city of Helsinki, Malminkartano, where my parents taught me the basics
  of survival. Once ready for more challenging living conditions, our family moved to
  <a href="http://www.siuntio.fi/">Siuntio</a>, the promised land of agriculture and livestock.
  It was here, in the vast wilderness of Siuntio, where I truly understood the warrior spirit of Finnish natives.
  I saw individuals who had lived their whole life fighting the raw elements of nature: bad-ass killer polar bears
  and the winters of great depression, yet somehow survived. The years of Siuntio were humble times.
  I learned important skills; such as making fire out of ice cones, and
  <span class="hilight">crushing your enemies with Judo</span>.

  After primary school it was again time to move forward. My path led me to to
  <a href="http://www.kirkkonummi.fi/">Kirkkonummi</a>, Kantvik City, from where I went to Finnish secondary school
  in Masala <a href="http://www.sepankoulu.fi/">Sepän koulu</a>. I studied in a
  <span class="hilight">virtual class -program</span> where I was able to apply the advanced computing skills I had
  learned in the wilderness of Siuntio. Then it was time to move to
  <a href="http://www.tapiolanlukio.fi/">Tapiolan lukio</a> high school, from where I graduated in year 2002.
</p>

<p>
  In Finland we have this thing called compulsory military service. Awesome. So after high school I spent one year
  playing Rambo in the forest of Finland in Riihimäki Viestirykmentti. As a military police I learned many useful
  skills; such as yelling <em class="hilight">Stop! Military police!</em> and
  <em class="hilight">Put the knife down!</em>
</p>

<p>
  After army it was time to recalibrate my brain. So in September 2003 I stared my Ph.D. studies in the
  Helsinki University of Technology, now known as the <a href="http://www.aalto.fi/en/">Aalto University</a>.
  In February 2009 I graduated with distinction from the
  <a href="http://cse.aalto.fi/en/">Department of Computer Science and Engineering</a>.
</p>

<p>Now I am an adult. So I go to work, and reminisce the years of past glory.</p>

      <h3>Oh, children. The year was...</h3>
      <p>
        <span class="hilight">1989</span> when 6-year-old Pyppe got introduced with the ways of Judo.
        In Siuntio the mastery of martial arts becomes a necessity for survival
        during the first weeks of primary school. After all, it is a treacherous hike from home to school
        filled with many dangers: in the prairie wolves and polar bears prowl the weary, and near the train station
        5th and 6th graders will eat you alive if show any signs of weakness.

      <p>
        Perhaps the most noteworthy accomplishments of my Judo competitions are bronze medals from the Finnish junior nationals
        in years 1997 and 1999, 5th place in the men's Finnish nationals, and silver and gold medals in Ne-Waza years 2000 and 2003.
